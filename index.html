               <p><b>CHALLENGES</b></p><p>Challenges in life are there to speed me up
                Challenges in life are not there to make me give up
                My darkest hour comes before dawn
                And for this reason I'm not going to feel down</p>
                
                <p>I was told that when I'm about to look away 
                that's when God creates a way 
                No pain no gain, I mist break this chain
                And even though am slow, That doesn't make me low</p>
                
                <p>I won't listen to a discriminating companion 
                For I'm a champion
                Each day comes with its won challenges
                But we have to understand the term dream</p>
                
                <p>We must have to make it
                Or else make it our dreams define us
                Speak it and fight for it
                Be proud let others people's doubs serve as reinforcements</p>
                
                <p>Let challenges and obstacles identify our opportunities 
                We have power of choice, we have power to live our our dream
                Drain it and die Dee it and live it
                We have to make all sacrifices when called upon
                            Persevere in the name of our dream!?!?</p>

              <p><b>FRIENDS</b></p>
              <p>As we all grow, so do we learn 
                We choose friends but don't figure how 
                All are not the same, people are different 
                Be wise, beware of anyone around</p>
                
                <p>No need fo hurry make friends
                We all have life's misfortunes
                Friends are not what we think
                They are a burden to others</p>
                
                <p>We think, we talk, we walk
                We all use what we got
                Life is about bigger deals
                Friends do help at a point</p>
                
               <p>Friends are important in one's life 
                They offer emotional and physical support 
                We need friends in life
                To share with them our moments</p>
                
                <p>A pal ready to fight
                Not to take fright
                One with passion
                Not without compassion 
                Choose one who deserves  you </p>

                <P><b>UNBOUND LOVER</b></P>
                <p>Love us like smoke, made with the fine of sighs
                  Being purified, a fire sparkling in lover's eyes
                  Love sees the unseen, does the impossible 
                  They say you fall in love once, that's not true
                  Setting eyes on her, makes you fall in love over again</p>
                  
                  <p>Love is pardoned, when there is injury
                  It understands with no consent, loves without refusal
                  Separation is a wound, that NO one can heal
                  Remembrance is a gift that no one can steal 
                  They say tale me in your arms, yet they're taken</p>
              
                  <p>The precious book of love, this unbound lover
                  To beautify him only lack a cover
                  The fish lives around, and is very proud
                  What is it else?? A madness most discreet</p>.
